Project: Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System (MVP)
Prepared For: Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region / Ministry of Tourism / Ministry
of Home Affairs
Category: Software (Travel & Tourism Safety)
Version: 1.0 (MVP)

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this system is to provide a secure, real-time safety monitoring solution for
tourists using Blockchain (Digital ID), AI (Anomaly Detection), and Geo-fencing. The MVP
focuses on core features: Digital ID, Mobile App with panic button & geo-fencing, AI-based
anomaly alerts, and Police/Tourism Dashboard.

1.2 Scope
●​ Tourists: Secure digital ID, location-based safety monitoring, panic button.​
●​ Authorities (Tourism & Police): Dashboard for real-time alerts, location tracking, and
incident management.​
●​ Families: Optional location-sharing.​

This will increase tourist safety, faster response times, and data-driven monitoring in high-risk
regions (e.g., Northeast India).

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations
●​ Digital ID: Blockchain-based temporary ID for tourists.​

●​ Geo-fencing: Location-based boundary alerts.​
●​ AI Anomaly Detection: Automated detection of unusual tourist behaviour.​
●​ E-FIR: Electronic First Information Report.​

1.4 References
●​ Ministry of Tourism Guidelines.​
●​ IEEE SRS Standard (IEEE 830).​

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The system consists of:
●​ Tourist Mobile App (Android/iOS – React Native).​
●​ Backend (Express.js/Django REST API with PostgreSQL + Blockchain).​
●​ Police/Tourism Dashboard (React.js web app).​
●​ AI Rule-based anomaly detection engine.​

2.2 Product Functions (MVP)
1.​ Generate and store Digital Tourist ID on Blockchain.​
2.​ Tourist login via Mobile App.​
3.​ Geo-fencing alerts when entering restricted/high-risk zones.​
4.​ Panic button for SOS alerts.​
5.​ AI anomaly detection: inactivity, sudden drop-off, route deviation.​

6.​ Police/Tourism Dashboard: real-time alerts, maps, incident logs.​

2.3 User Characteristics
●​ Tourists: Basic smartphone users, multilingual needs.​
●​ Police/Tourism Officers: Basic IT skills, dashboard operators.​
●​ System Admins: Technical staff for backend maintenance.​

2.4 Constraints
●​ MVP will not include IoT wearables, multilingual support, or advanced ML models.​
●​ Internet connectivity required for real-time monitoring.​
●​ Limited blockchain integration (testnet for MVP).​

2.5 Assumptions & Dependencies
●​ Tourists have smartphones with GPS enabled.​
●​ Police/Tourism departments have internet access.​
●​ Blockchain infrastructure is hosted on a government or NIC-supported server.​

3. Specific Requirements
3.1 Functional Requirements
A. Tourist Mobile App
●​ FR-1: Register/Login with Blockchain-based Digital ID.​
●​ FR-2: Display safety score (basic rule-based).​
●​ FR-3: Trigger geo-fencing alerts.​

●​ FR-4: Panic button sends live location & ID to dashboard.​
●​ FR-5: Share real-time location with family (opt-in).​

B. AI Anomaly Detection
●​ FR-6: Detect inactivity > X hours.​
●​ FR-7: Detect sudden location drop/loss of signal.​
●​ FR-8: Detect deviation from planned route.​
●​ FR-9: Send anomaly alerts to dashboard.​

C. Police/Tourism Dashboard
●​ FR-10: View tourists on live map.​
●​ FR-11: Receive panic button alerts.​
●​ FR-12: View Digital ID & itinerary details.​
●​ FR-13: View anomaly alerts.​
●​ FR-14: Maintain incident log.​

D. Blockchain Digital ID System
●​ FR-15: Generate Digital ID linked to KYC & itinerary.​
●​ FR-16: Store ID on Blockchain (tamper-proof).​
●​ FR-17: Expire ID automatically at end of trip.​

3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
●​ NFR-1 (Performance): Alerts should reach dashboard within 5 seconds of
panic/anomaly.​

●​ NFR-2 (Scalability): System should support 10,000+ active tourists simultaneously.​
●​ NFR-3 (Security): End-to-end encryption (AES-256), OAuth2.0 authentication,
tamper-proof Blockchain.​
●​ NFR-4 (Availability): 99.5% uptime.​
●​ NFR-5 (Usability): Tourist app should support English for MVP (multilingual later).​
●​ NFR-6 (Maintainability): Modular microservices-based backend.​

4. System Models
4.1 Use Case Diagram (MVP)
Actors: Tourist, Police Officer, System Admin
Use Cases: Register, Login, Panic Alert, Geo-fence Alert, Anomaly Detection, View Dashboard,
Log Incident.

4.2 Data Flow (High-Level)
1.​ Tourist registers → Blockchain Digital ID created.​
2.​ Tourist app sends location → Geo-fencing checks.​
3.​ Panic button / anomaly triggers alert.​
4.​ Backend forwards alert → Police Dashboard.​
5.​ Dashboard logs incident.​

5. MVP Deliverables
●​ Tourist Mobile App (React Native).​

●​ Backend APIs + Blockchain ID module.​
●​ Police/Tourism Dashboard (React.js).​
●​ Rule-based AI anomaly detection service.​
